## Model Explanation 
- In these two graphs, it shows how more items with a low fat content and overall generally healthier items sold more than the higher fat content. 
- As you can see in the first graph, the low fat content sales were higher than the regular fat content. In the second graph, it shows how fruits and vegetables sold more than any other items.
## Recommendations
- I would recommend selling more items like healither foods or a low fat content for a cheaper price to continue increasing sales.
